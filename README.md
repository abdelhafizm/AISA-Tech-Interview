# AISA-Tech-Interview

You are given a text file consisting of multiple integers. The file is structured such that there are multiple lines of integers, each line containing multiple integers each separated by a space. 

# Preparation
To begin, clone the repo, switch to the branch ```starter-<FIRSTNAME>-<LASTNAME>``` then create a new branch call ```functionality-<FIRSTNAME>-<LASTNAME>``` to add your functionality. 

# Tasks
On the branch you created, add functionality that fulfils the following tasks. You are allowed to change the skeleton functions as you see fit. You're also allowed (encouraged) to add helper functions, but the main call should be to the ```run_interview``` provided. You **may not** change the ```if __name__ == '__main__'``` code block. 

### Question 1:

Write a program that outputs:

1. How many numbers are in the dataset.
2. The sum of the numbers. 
3. The average of the numbers. 

### Question 2: 

Write a program that outputs:

1. How many unique numbers are in the dataset. 
2. Which numbers show up more than twice in the dataset, and how many times do they appear.

# Submission
To submit your work, push your branch to the repo, then create a pull request to merge your work into ```starter-<FIRSTNAME>-<LASTNAME>```, then approve your own pull request.
